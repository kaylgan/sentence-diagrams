resolved 20200910: rotation
  added 1-5 key rotations

+ add on focus to buttons in text area

+ delete multiple not working as expected... works okay unless elements are rotated?
+ resize also not working with rotation
+ on second drag, multiple elements not updating with arrow keys until after mouse movement
+ line/platform rotation cursor position
+ don't apply gerunds, etc. to line/platform (but do apply line color/text color, alignment)
+ return (new line) in text area keeps words as one
